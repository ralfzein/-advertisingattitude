     Abu Dhabi Duty Free asked us to bridge that gap, to
      transform a transit space built for speed into a 
      destination for love, gifting, and sales.

     <div class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] tracking-normal text-background"> 
      
<br/> Travel retail has scale, but rarely feeling. Most promotions blur into background noise. Valentine’s needed to stand out in a cluttered environment and become something passengers couldn’t ignore. Not just discounts on shelves, but a campaign that made travelers pause, engage, and buy.
</div> </h1>
      <p class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background ">
  
The ambition was to move Valentine’s beyond a transactional offer and into an experience. Our insight: airports are full of emotion, reunions, goodbyes, surprises. Valentine’s was the perfect moment to amplify that truth and connect it with Abu Dhabi Duty Free’s retail power. Instead of running a quiet promotion, we built a campaign designed to shout love, across corridors, activations, and prime storefronts.
<br/>
<br/>

The big idea became: “Valentine’s All Over the Emirates.” Abu Dhabi Duty Free wasn’t just a retailer; it became a stage for love, translating the season into a campaign system that blended offers, storytelling, and immersive theatre. Guided by our SwirlBold™ mentality, it combined disruptive Valentine’s visuals with disciplined, high-impact placements that drove gifting sales.
<br/>
<br/>

We designed a Valentine’s identity filled with ribbons, petals, and bold typography. We reimagined 40% beauty promotions as “love notes” across gondolas, podiums, and aisles. Oversized digital screens and campaign takeovers dominated high-traffic placements, from Chanel frontage to departure corridors. The result was a unified campaign system that lived across in-store, digital, and experiential touchpoints.
<br/>
<br/>

Passengers stopped to look. They smiled. And they shopped. Valentine’s became more than a seasonal promotion — it turned travel into celebration. For Abu Dhabi Duty Free, the results were tangible: increased engagement in beauty and gifting zones, more dwell time in promotional areas, and higher visibility across the airport. For us, it was proof that retail campaigns, when strategically built, can shift behaviour even in the fastest-moving environments.
<br/>
<br/>

This project reflects how Advertising Attitude operates. We’re not a content studio or a signage vendor — we’re a strategic marketing agency. We build clarity-first systems that scale across bold creativity, emotional depth, and strategic clarity.
<br/>
<br/>
Guided by our SwirlBold™ mentality, we pair disruptive creativity with disciplined execution. The result? Not just seasonal engagement, but a campaign that moved passengers, activated retail, and proved what emotional branding can do in airports.

Beirut Duty Free challenged us with one of their most complex tasks: amplify more than 200 exclusive promotions in a way that passengers couldn’t miss.
    
     <div class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] tracking-normal text-background"> 
<br/>
     In travel retail, discounts are everywhere. Shoppers are bombarded with signs, shelf-talkers, and competing offers. The risk? Promotions fade into background noise, with passengers rushing past without engaging. Beirut Duty Free needed more than banners; they needed an outreach system, a way to turn discounts into conversations, and conversations into purchases. 
     </div>
</h1>
      
      <p class="mt-8 font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background ">

Our insight was simple: passengers don’t buy what they don’t know exists. With over 200 offers, the challenge wasn’t price, it was visibility and clarity. Every promotion had to be seen, understood, and activated in the split seconds travelers spend moving through duty free. That meant rethinking outreach as not just signage, but as a strategic marketing engine.<br/><br/>
We designed a cohesive system that blended digital storytelling, quantified messaging, and retail placement strategy. Instead of static signs, we built bold, high-contrast visuals that reframed offers into headlines passengers could digest instantly: “Save $30 vs Singles,” “Twinpacks Promo Bar,” “Exclusive $20 Off.” The creative direction leaned on sharp typographic cues, vibrant gradients, and repetition across zones to reinforce recall.<br/><br/>
Placement was as critical as design. We transformed key high-traffic touchpoints into campaign hotspots: cash desks, liquor aisles, twinpack gondolas, and digital walls. Each acted as an outreach hub, carrying promotions where passengers naturally stopped, queued, or made choices. Messaging consistency across these hotspots created the sense of one unified campaign, not scattered offers.<br/><br/>
The impact was immediate. Passengers noticed, asked, explored, and shopped more. With visibility amplified, promotions moved from curiosity to cart. Beirut Duty Free didn’t just list discounts; they activated demand. More dwell time in promotional areas, increased interaction at cash desks, and stronger pull for liquor and gifting zones proved the system worked.<br/><br/>
For us, this case proved that outreach isn’t decoration — it’s demand creation. Strategic visibility turned 200 promotions into 200 reasons to engage, buy, and return.<br/><br/>

        Real estate marketing is usually passive: list specs, show floor plans, wait for calls. D-VIA by K&A demanded more. A brutalist tower on the Dbayeh highway, with seven premium office floors above a flagship pharmacy, needed to be more than a property listing. It needed to feel like a brand with edge, and sell out fast.
  <div class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] tracking-normal text-background"> 
<br/>
Our ambition: position D-VIA as a micro-community for growth-driven companies, then lease all seven floors and the rooftop. To get there, we rejected conventional real estate playbooks and built a led agency marketing model that fused concept design, performance marketing, and physical activation.
     </div>
    </h1>
      
      <p class="mt-8 font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background">
The identity started with a name, D-VIA — blending “Dbayeh” with “via” (route, way). This turned a location into momentum. We designed a bold, brutalist-inspired system of typography, visuals, and copy that spoke in the language of business: scale, presence, visibility, edge.<br/><br/>
Activation was omnichannel by design.<br/><br/>
<span class="font-M_bold">Performance marketing </span> — Google Ads, retargeting funnels, affiliate PR features, and outbound email/WhatsApp pipelines to drive leads. <br/>
<span class="font-M_bold">  Sales tools </span> — QR codes, landing pages, digital brochures, booking forms, and AI-generated interiors to help prospects picture themselves in the space.<br/>
<span class="font-M_bold"> Retail-to-real-estate crossover </span> — leveraging the pharmacy’s flagship storefront at ground level: branded leaflets, roll-ups, and point-of-sale materials that sold offices to thousands of daily walk-ins. <br/>
<span class="font-M_bold"> Out-of-home impact </span> — animated creative on the tower’s outdoor screen, highway-visible branding, and presence across internal corridors.<br/><br/>
In total, 15+ interlinked creative assets formed a campaign ecosystem: floor plans, rooftop concepts, neighborhood maps, in-store visuals, outdoor screens, and digital storytelling. Every touchpoint, online or offline, pulled decision-makers closer to leasing.<br/><br/>
The result: 100% occupancy. All 7 office floors leased, plus the rooftop — a rare outcome in Lebanon’s real estate market. For K&A, the building became a revenue engine. For us, it was proof that real estate can be sold like a brand, blending digital demand generation with retail activations that touch people in the spaces they already move through.<br/><br/>

    This project started as a simple seasonal brief — to design a Ramadan and Eid greeting for TRSS, part of ARI Group.
     But we saw an opportunity to go beyond a card and create a cohesive internal and external communication system that
      carried both brand identity and cultural empathy.
      
       
     </h1>
      
      <p class="mt-8 font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background ">
We designed two complete visual directions for the holy season:<br/><br/>
● Ramadan Kareem – reflecting spiritual warmth, reflection, and unity.<br/><br/>
● Eid Mubarak – expressing festivity, generosity, and modern Arabian luxury.<br/><br/>
Each concept was rooted in TRSS’s corporate — Abu Dhabi Duty Free’s Operator — tone but elevated through strategic storytelling and design consistency.<br/><br/>
The Ramadan visuals featured abstract desert dunes, a guiding crescent, and warm gradients symbolizing growth and generosity — connecting brand communication to human meaning. For Eid, we introduced a premium gifting extension: a luxury box and card design featuring a golden airplane across a crescent — visually merging travel, culture, and celebration.<br/><br/>
Beyond digital greetings, the system was applied across corporate communication, in-store displays, screens, and internal brand moments — unifying how the company celebrated with its employees, partners, and travelers.<br/><br/>
This was more than a seasonal gesture. It was a cultural brand exercise, proving that emotional intelligence can sit within corporate identity — and that even greetings can speak the brand’s language.<br/><br/>
TRSS’s Ramadan and Eid campaign demonstrated how design can strengthen culture, connection, and brand credibility at once. It reminded stakeholders that every message — even a greeting — is a brand opportunity.<br/><br/>

    This project began with a simple truth: kids don’t skip the chocolate aisle. They’re the real decision-makers in travel retail — tugging sleeves, pointing fingers, and turning “just browsing” into a sale.
     <div class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] tracking-normal text-background"> 
<br/>
      Muscat Duty Free’s Chocoflight Time campaign was born from that insight. We wanted to transform the chocolate section into a destination — playful, colorful, and irresistibly alive. The goal wasn’t to decorate shelves, but to create an experience built around behavior. 
     </div>
    </h1>
      
      <p class="mt-8 font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background ">
The concept introduced four mascot characters — Creamy, Caramel, Nutty, and Candy — each representing a chocolate type and personality. This segmentation gave structure to chaos, making the space easy to navigate and emotionally engaging — and intellectually delightful — for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>
The design drew from toy and logo design logic — playful illustrations, simple storytelling, and a rhythm of color that made the section feel like its own world within the store. Visually, it was designed to scale: mascots that could walk the store floor, trail floor stickers, danglers, value and hero offer cases that could extend to promotions, and wobbler signage that could grow into full retail experiences. All built under one unified Muscat Duty Free brand world.<br/><br/>
Commercially, the concept was designed to drive subconscious purchase behavior — boosting section sales while optimizing long-term brand positioning. The goal was clear: make the chocolate zone and offerings a must-visit destination, and make its products a must-buy for self, family, or gifting every time passengers travel.<br/><br/>
Because when kids smile, parents buy. And when design feels joyful, even adults remember what it’s like to be one.<br/><br/>

    In an airport, attention is currency. Seconds decide whether passengers notice an offer or rush past it. Abu Dhabi Duty Free gave us one of the highest-stakes briefs in travel retail: dominate prime digital real estate with a 40% fragrance promotion and make it impossible to ignore.
     <div class=" font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] tracking-normal text-background"> 
<br/>
The challenge wasn’t the deal — it was visibility. Travel retail is saturated with promotions. Passengers are bombarded by banners, shelf-talkers, and digital signs across every category. The risk was simple: the 40% offer would fade into the noise. We needed to build a campaign that cut through instantly, stuck in memory, and traveled with passengers across the terminal.
     </div>
    </h1>
      
   <p class="mt-8 font-M_semibold text-[1.3rem] leading-[1.6rem] text-background ">
Our strategy was radical minimalism with maximum impact. Instead of cluttered visuals, we built the campaign around one unmistakable device: red. A color that signals urgency, commands attention, and pulls focus even in motion-heavy spaces. Red wasn’t an aesthetic choice — it was the strategy.</br/><br/>
We translated this intoThe Red Thread, a digital takeover system designed to follow passengers on their journey. Escalators, corridors, and gates became synchronized canvases. Ultra-high contrast visuals paired with ultra-minimal copy — “Save Up to 40%” — repeated across placements until it became impossible not to register. Custom 8K animations ensured sharpness across the airport’s massive screens, reinforcing the offer in every glance.</br/><br/>
The execution leaned on discipline. Four design rules drove every asset:</br/><br/>
<span class="font-M_bold">High-contrast red </span> – an arresting backdrop in a sea of muted visuals .<br/> 
<span class="font-M_bold">Minimalist messaging </span>– reduced to the absolute essentials, no more, no less.<br/> 
 <span class="font-M_bold">Scale and motion</span> – screens, walls, and escalator panels moving with passengers.<br/> 
  <span class="font-M_bold">Consistency across touchpoints –</span> one message, many impressions, stitched into memory.</br/><br/>
The impact was immediate. Passengers didn’t just see the campaign — they asked for the 40% deal by name. The promotion became conversational currency at cash desks, with “the red campaign” recognized as shorthand for Abu Dhabi Duty Free’s offer. Sales of featured fragrances accelerated, dwell time near digital hotspots increased, and the campaign earned its space as a high-speed driver of retail conversion.</br/><br/>
For Abu Dhabi Duty Free, it was proof that digital real estate can work harder than passive screens. For us, it was validation that design and discipline, when paired, can engineer commercial outcomes at airport scale. This wasn’t just an ad; it was a red thread woven through the passenger journey, from escalator to checkout.</br/><br/>
